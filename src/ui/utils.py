    against the whole stylesheet. Freezing the CSS fade doesn't help — the cost
    is the per-frame hover hit-test + restyle itself, which CSS can't suppress.

    So we stop the picking outright: set `can-target = False` on the scrolled
    content during the scroll, so no row is ever hovered and GTK does zero
    per-frame hover work; restore it once motion stops. The `.is-scrolling`
