        no counterpart exists or the original is already an audio
        track.

        The ``thumb`` field matters: the album-cover image lives on a
        different CDN than the music-video still, so the caller needs
        the swapped thumb to avoid showing the video frame next to
        the swapped-in audio.

        Two-step lookup:

        1. `get_watch_playlist().tracks[0].counterpart` — YT Music's
           own pairing (the data behind the "Switch to song version"
           button). Authoritative when the counterpart is ATV. We
           also harvest title/artists from this response so callers
           don't need to pass them, and so we use the same names YT
           Music uses.

        2. Songs-filtered search — fallback when YT Music didn't pair
           the song/video in its catalog (happens fairly often;
           pairing seems to be curated per release rather than
           automatic). Conservative match: normalized title equality
           + artist name in result's artists.
