"""User preferences for the lyrics pipeline.

Covers four things, all stored in the shared ``prefs.json``:

- ``lyrics_provider_order`` — the search queue. An ordered list of
  provider display names; the chain tries them top-down.
- ``lyrics_providers_disabled`` — names the user switched off. Kept as a
  separate list (rather than dropping them from the order) so toggling a
  provider back on restores its position instead of appending it last.
- ``lyrics_match_mode`` — ``quality`` walks past a provider that only has
  plain unsynced text when a later one might have synced lyrics, falling
  back to the plain hit if nothing better turns up. ``strict`` takes the
  first provider that returns anything at all.
- ``lyrics_second_line`` / ``lyrics_effects`` — display options consumed
  by the lyrics widget.

A provider added in a later release isn't in the saved order, so
:func:`provider_order` appends unknown-but-known-to-the-app names at the
end rather than losing them.

Reads are mtime-cached: the fetch chain asks for the order on every
track change from a worker thread, and the widget asks per row build.
