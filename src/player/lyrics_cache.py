"""Disk-backed cache for lyrics fetched from any provider.

One JSON file per videoId at ``~/.cache/ventapes/lyrics/<video_id>.json``.
Schema:

    {
        "preferred_source": "Paxsenix (Apple Music)" | null,
        "results": {
            "<source name>": {
                "lines": [{"start": float|null, "text": str, ...}, ...],
                "synced": bool,
                "source": str
            },
            ...
        }
    }

``preferred_source`` is the user's pinned choice for this track (``null``
means "use whatever the chain returned best"). The lyrics view's source
picker writes to this field; ``get_lyrics`` reads it before falling back
to the highest-ranked result.

Lyrics don't change once written so entries live forever; the cache is
bounded by a soft cap that evicts the least-recently-used file on insert.

# Bumped whenever the fetch/parse pipeline starts producing better data

# already played without them knowing to clear anything.
#
#   2 — Apple Music parsed from its TTML (word timing, romanization,
#       translations, background vocals); Unicode-aware artist matching;
#       NetEase romanization/translation tracks.
#   3 — Search hits gated on duration and version before the
#       richest-lyrics walk, so a different song can no longer be served
#       in place of the track.
#   4 — Romanization merged in from a second provider when the one that
#       won the lyrics doesn't carry one.
#   5 — Korean romanization generated locally.
#   6 — Apple Music catalog resolved through the public iTunes Search
#       API, so tracks the JWT scrape couldn't reach are found now.
#   7 — Cyrillic romanization generated locally; NetEase search hits
#       gated the same way Apple's and BiniLyrics' are.
#   8 — Duet voice recorded per line, so the second singer's lines can
#       sit against the opposite edge.
#   9 — Artist takes precedence over title when picking a search hit, so
#       a same-title track by someone else can't win.
#  10 — Romanization gaps completed from a local dictionary.
#  11 — Second line applied to manually picked sources too, not just the
#       one the chain settled on.
#  12 — Store watermarks stripped from the top of a lyric.
